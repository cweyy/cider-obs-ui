# ðŸŽ¶ Cider OBS UI ðŸŽ§

This project is a web-based user interface that displays currently playing music data captured from Cider Websockets and presents it in an aesthetically pleasing format using HTML and CSS. The UI can be accessed through this link: [https://cider_obs_ui-1-n3787008.deta.app/](https://cider_obs_ui-1-n3787008.deta.app/)

## How to use it in OBS

1.  Open OBS and navigate to the Scene you want to add the UI to.
2.  Click on the "+" button in the "Sources" section of the Scene.
3.  Select "Browser" from the list of available sources.
4.  Enter the URL for the UI ([https://cider_obs_ui-1-n3787008.deta.app/](https://cider_obs_ui-1-n3787008.deta.app/)) into the "URL" field.
5.  Adjust the width and height of the source as necessary to fit your Scene.
6.  Click "OK" to add the source to your Scene.

## How it works

The Cider OBS UI works by establishing a connection to the Cider Websocket, which captures data about the currently playing music. This data is then extracted and processed using JavaScript, and presented on the user interface using HTML and CSS. The UI is designed to update in real-time, displaying accurate information about the currently playing song.
